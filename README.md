This repository contains source code and slides for the talk "Why you should be using tidymodels" at UW-Madison in November 2023.

<h3 align=center> [Slides](https://simonpcouch.github.io/tidymodels-uw-2023) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; [Example Notebook](https://simonpcouch.github.io/tidymodels-uw-2023/example) </h3>

<br> 

The slides are a deployed Quarto presentation, and the example notebook is a demo applied analysis on modeling flight delays out of Madison, WI with tidymodels.

In this repository,

-   `index.qmd` contains the source code for the slides. The slides use images in the `/figures` directory.
-   `/example` contains the source code for the example notebook.
-   `/docs` is auto-generated from `/example/index.qmd` and is post-processed with `downlit.R`. Content in that folder is likely unhelpful for a human reader, and is better viewed at the links above. :)
